          "Download and install the command line version of the Git version control system if you don't already have it. All code you write from now on (for the entire year!) must be added and committed to a Git repository that you create and manage. For this term I recommend that you make one repository for all your work. Inside this repo/folder each assignment is its own folder. So you'll have one repo and within it folders for HW1, HW2, etc."
      </span> </h5>
      <h5><span class="w3-opacity">
        Create a new folder in your Git repository, preferably named HW2. Create a new feature branch for your work on this homework, check it out and proceed. Create an index.html and stylesheet (e.g. styles.css) directly in that folder. Write your CSS in this stylesheet file. You can write the Javascript directly in the html file if you want."

                I copied HW1 folder within the krule repository, renamed it HW2, and made this blog page blank. I then pushed to git. Then I made a new branch named "developer". Then I realized that the name was supposed to be "feature", and so I moved out of the developer branch and made the feature branch.

                                Think for a bit about what you'd like to do. You need to take input from the user, do some calculation and then provide the output/answer back to the user by modifying elements on the page and adding new elements.
                </span></h5>
                <h5> <span class="w3-opacity">
                                Create a wireframe or sketch of your page to help you with the design. A good idea is to overlay it with the rows and columns of your selected Bootstrap grid, and plan for how it will look when the page is resized. Label it with with the container, row, and column classed elements to visualize your layout.

                       Because I was copying from myself, and because my previous project was themed around a show, I decided to do a personality test. It would take user input, record their inputs, and calculate a result that could easily be put into a table. This is my drawing. I knew that I wanted to copy this blog style for the questions. But I thought I would be able to do a lot of fancy stuff I didn't have time to do.

                <p>
                     I made a monumental mistake. I pushed all of this to the wrong repository. I think what happened was that when I was trying to make the feature branch instead of the developer branch, I put the developer branch on a personal repository that I had, rather than my school repository. This resulted in apparently turning this project in really really late.

                        Create your working page, remembering to style it nicely and to use Bootstrap for your layout. As with HW 1, you'll need a minimum of 2 files: index.html and styles.css plus a *.js file if you feel like putting your javascript in a separate file also. 
                </span></h5>

                 Since I copied from both my HW1 page and my HW1 blog page for this project, I didn't really have to work on making it look pretty, making a css file, or getting bootstrap to run. It was all about the javascript, which I put in its own file. all in all, I'm pretty proud of it, even though it doesnt do all that much.

                                Commit and push your work frequently on your feature branch but don't merge until you are happy with it and have tested it thoroughly.

                  <h5><span class="w3-opacity">
                                To make sure your feature branch shows up in the commit history, at some point make sure to put at least one commit on master before merging. The actual work in the commit doesn't matter; you could just edit the README. This will advance that branch past the branching point and will leave it nicely visible.

                           Once I had a method or piece of code working, I would push it. To make this blog, I pulled from master and am now editing it. After completing this blog, I intend to push it to master so that I have something on master before it merges. This blog shouldn't conflict with any merges on the development branch.
